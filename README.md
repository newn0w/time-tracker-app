## Time Tracker (Unfinished Project)

A basic time tracker application to monitor process activity and log time spent across processes.

### **Description**

This project is an unfinished time tracker application built using Python's Tkinter library. It currently features a treeview that displays a list of running processes, along with their names and logged time. The application aims to provide a simple and intuitive way to track time spent on various processes, helping users stay productive and focused.






### **Functionality**

The application utilizes Tkinter to create a graphical user interface with a treeview element. The treeview displays the names of running processes and the dynamically tracks time spent using them. The following functionalities are currently implemented:

- Process tracking: The application dynamically tracks the process currently focused in the foreground and updates the time spent on said process in real-time.
- Treeview display: The processes are displayed in a treeview format, allowing for ease of navigation and viewing of process information.




    

### **Technologies Used**

- Python
- Tkinter
- psutil (for process tracking)






### **Installation**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python and Tkinter installed.
3. Run the `setup.py` script.




    

### **Known Issues and Limitations**

- The project is unfinished and lacks functionalities such as sorting, filtering, and detailed process information.
- The application is Windows exclusive and may not work correctly on all operating systems or environments.




    

### **Conclusion**

This project served as a learning experience in building desktop applications with Tkinter. I hope to potentially return to this project in the future. If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, please feel free to share!

### **Additional Notes**

- This project is open-source and available for anyone to use and modify.
- I appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement, and I will do my best to address them in any potential future updates.
